# Scrum Board API

This folder contains the source code for the Scrum Board API.
It is an API built using Django Rest Framework [DRF](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) that mimics the Scrum Style development of managing tasks in the current sprint, moving tasks from backlog into the set of tasks to be completed etc.

### Set Up
Coming Soon :)
